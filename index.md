## About Me

Hello! I am currently a PhD student at South China University of Technology, majoring in Information and Communication Engineering. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for advancing communication technologies and exploring the potential of deep learning algorithms in signal processing.

## Academic Journey Highlights 

- **Bachelor of Engineering in Communication Engineering**  
  *Beijing Jiaotong University, 2021*  
  My graduation project was titled **"FPGA Design of UART Instruction Controller"**. In this project, I developed a method to design a universal asynchronous transceiver (UART) instruction control design. The design specifications included:
  - **Port Type:** UART
  - **System Clock Frequency:** 24MHz
  - **FPGA Board Type:** Altera Cyclone I
  - **Baud Rate:** 9600
  - **Instruction Set Architecture:** a+b, ~a, a^b, a*b

- **Master of Engineering in Information and Communication Engineering**  
  *Beijing Jiaotong University, 2024*  
  My master thesis was titled **"Deep-Learning Based Rain Attenuation Prediction Modeling for Microwave and mmWave Band"**. I focused on applying AI algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, to predict the impact of weather impairments such as rainfall on modern communication bands, including microwave, mmWave, and THz bands. My research led to the publication of a conference paper titled **"Rain Attenuation Prediction Modeling for Microwave and Millimeter Wave Band Using LSTM"**.

## Current Research

As a fresh PhD student, my research projects are centered around **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**, also known as **Joint Sensing and Communication (JSC)**. This is a key feature of 6G technology, aiming to integrate communication and sensing functionalities into a unified system.
