## ModelSim Software (FPGA Design of UART Instruction Controller_Bachelor Degree Project) 

During my bachelor degree graduation project, I learned and used the [ModelSim](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/750368/modelsim-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-18-1.html?) software. I wrote **Verilog HDL** block codes and simulate them in this software. One of the feature of this simulation software is that the execution of each block code is simultaneous, meaning that in ModelSim, there is not a line by line code execution as the we use to know in other programing languages.

## Matlab, Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, python(Deep Learning based Rain Attenuation prediction Modeling for Microwave and mmWave Band_Master Degree Thesis Project)
During my master degree study, I have learned matlab and used it quite a lot in lab projecs frequenntly. As for my graduation thesis, I also learned deep learning technique and able to develop LSTM algorithm which can be used to predict the rain attenuation. I have developed an in depth understanding of deep learing technique alongside with matlab and python. The following images are taken from this research work.

## Other resources

I have a number of other programing skills such as c/c++, java, css ... that I have learned during my software engineering training hosted by [ALX](https://www.alxethiopia.com/software-engineering-plus/). I have done a lot of projects in this training and they all are available in my [Github](https://github.com/Endale24?tab=repositories).
