I am a Wireless Communication researcher affillated with Beijing Jiaotong University(former) and South China University of Technology(Pressent). Currently, I am working on integrated sensing and communication(ISAC) or sometimes refered to as joint sensing and communication(JSC). My Academic jorney is pressented as follow; 

M.Sc. in Information and Communication Engineering
======
# Beijing Jiaotong University [ 01/09/2021 – 15/06/2024 ]
# Thesis: Deep-Learning Based Rain Attenuation Prediction Modeling for Microwave and mmWave Band
      In this research work, I focused on applying AI algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, to predict the impact of weather impairments such as rainfall on modern communication bands, including microwave, mmWave, and THz bands. 
# Main Courses:
- New wireless communication technologies                    - Wireless Channel Theory and Modeling Methods
- 5G mobile communication array signal processing            - OFDM Mobile Communication Technology
- Communication Signal Processing                            - Digital Communication Theory
- Cellular based Internet of Things Technology               - Microwave Theory and Technology
- Optimization Method                                        - Maths-Physics Equation
'My research experience as a master's degree student at Beijing Jiaotong University, School of Eletronics and Information Engineering, Institute of Modern Communication, was focused on fundamentals of wireless comunication technology. I have had the chance to learn the major technologies of wireless communication such as MIMO, OFDM, IoT and AI algorithms such as that of deep learning fundametals and it's application in wireless tech. I have also had the opportunity to work together with my lab mates on different projects. Under my supervisor's [Prof. Xiong Lei](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/eie/8077.html) kind guidance and supervison, I have successfully complitted my master's thesis on the aforementioned title and my work has been accepted for [MLISE 2024 Conference](http://mlise.org/) and has been published on IEEE.
